    "description": "XPX is a novel RAP token (Ratcheting Asset Peg) 🔧, similar to a stablecoin pegged to WAX. It operates with a market maker where buy orders are placed for the same amount of XPX sold. There are no team-allocated XPX tokens, no marketing budget, just 100% of the supply listed on the market 📊. XPX will consistently have reward pools 💎 but will never serve as the reward token itself. To maintain its value, XPX employs a strategy where every XPX token sold is used to buy back the token. When the sell order is gone, XPX starts ratcheting, moving up the starting price 2% while maintaining market stabilization mechanisms that rise as well 📈. You can run this market maker by executing the 'partytime' action on maker.xpx with freecover = 0 ⚙️. The market maker targets a support level of 0.98 WAX with 62% of liquidity and an additional 10% at 0.96 WAX, and descending orders until 0.62. The weighted gap in all buy orders is calculated to be 6.6%, which is taken as fees to run the project 🔍. If you've never searched XPX under Alcor farms, you will 🌾.",

The contract is governed exclusively by the mining weight of its participants, who can vote to modify the contract’s ABI/WASM and transaction fees. wax{cache} operates with one-hour block intervals, featuring an initial block reward of 26.2144 WCACHE, which halves every 20,000 blocks, and incorporates token burns dynamically pegged to RAM prices. Deployed on three leading Antelope Networks, including WAX, TELOS, and EOS, each with its own token (WCACHE, TCACHE, and ECACHE respectively), it not only creates cross-chain RAM arbitrage opportunities but also redefines the concept of commodity-backed cash, specifically RAM-backed cash."
